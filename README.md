Question #16Topic 1
Your company has three virtual machines (VMs) that are included in an availability set.
You try to resize one of the VMs, which returns an allocation failure message.
It is imperative that the VM is resized.
Which of the following actions should you take?
A. You should only stop one of the VMs.
B. You should stop two of the VMs.
C. You should stop all three VMs. Most Voted
D. You should remove the necessary VM from the availability set.
Correct Answer: C üó≥Ô∏è
If the VM you wish to resize is part of an availability set, then you must stop all VMs in the availability set before changing the size of any VM in the availability set.
The reason all VMs in the availability set must be stopped before performing the resize operation to a size that requires different hardware is that all running VMs in the availability set must be using the same physical hardware cluster. Therefore, if a change of physical hardware cluster is required to change the VM size then all VMs must be first stopped and then restarted one-by-one to a different physical hardware clusters.

Correct Answer: B üó≥Ô∏è
Each virtual machine in your availability set is assigned an update domain and a fault domain by the underlying Azure platform. For a given availability set, five non-user-configurable update domains are assigned by default (Resource Manager deployments can then be increased to provide up to 20 update domains) to indicate groups of virtual machines and underlying physical hardware that can be rebooted at the same time.



question 20 
DRAG DROP -
You have downloaded an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template to deploy numerous virtual machines (VMs). The ARM template is based on a current VM, but must be adapted to reference an administrative password.
You need to make sure that the password cannot be stored in plain text.
You are preparing to create the necessary components to achieve your goal.
Which of the following should you create to achieve your goal? Answer by dragging the correct option from the list to the answer area.

Question #21Topic 1
Your company has an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant that is configured for hybrid coexistence with the on-premises Active Directory domain.
The on-premise virtual environment consists of virtual machines (VMs) running on Windows Server 2012 R2 Hyper-V host servers.
You have created some PowerShell scripts to automate the configuration of newly created VMs. You plan to create several new VMs.
You need a solution that ensures the scripts are run on the new VMs.
Which of the following is the best solution?
A. Configure a SetupComplete.cmd batch file in the %windir%\setup\scripts directory. Most Voted
B. Configure a Group Policy Object (GPO) to run the scripts as logon scripts.
C. Configure a Group Policy Object (GPO) to run the scripts as startup scripts.
D. Place the scripts in a new virtual hard disk (VHD).
 
Correct Answer: A üó≥Ô∏è
After you deploy a Virtual Machine you typically need to make some changes before it's ready to use. This is something you can do manually or you could use
Remote PowerShell to automate the configuration of your VM after deployment for example.
But now there's a third alternative available allowing you customize your VM: the CustomScriptextension.
This CustomScript extension is executed by the VM Agent and it's very straightforward: you specify which files it needs to download from your storage account and which file it needs to execute. You can even specify arguments that need to be passed to the script. The only requirement is that you execute a .ps1 file.

Question #22Topic 1
Your company has an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant that is configured for hybrid coexistence with the on-premises Active Directory domain.
You plan to deploy several new virtual machines (VMs) in Azure. The VMs will have the same operating system and custom software requirements.
You configure a reference VM in the on-premise virtual environment. You then generalize the VM to create an image.
You need to upload the image to Azure to ensure that it is available for selection when you create the new Azure VMs.
Which PowerShell cmdlets should you use?
A. Add-AzVM
B. Add-AzVhd Most Voted
C. Add-AzImage
D. Add-AzImageDataDisk
 
Correct Answer: B üó≥Ô∏è

Note: The question is included in a number of questions that depicts the identical set-up. However, every question has a distinctive result. Establish if the solution satisfies the requirements.
Your company's Azure subscription includes two Azure networks named VirtualNetworkA and VirtualNetworkB.
VirtualNetworkA includes a VPN gateway that is configured to make use of static routing. Also, a site-to-site VPN connection exists between your company's on- premises network and VirtualNetworkA.
You have configured a point-to-site VPN connection to VirtualNetworkA from a workstation running Windows 10. After configuring virtual network peering between
VirtualNetworkA and VirtualNetworkB, you confirm that you are able to access VirtualNetworkB from the company's on-premises network. However, you find that you cannot establish a connection to VirtualNetworkB from the Windows 10 workstation.
You have to make sure that a connection to VirtualNetworkB can be established from the Windows 10 workstation.
Solution: You choose the Allow gateway transit setting on VirtualNetworkA.
Does the solution meet the goal?
A. Yes
B. No Most Voted
"After configuring virtual network peering between
VirtualNetworkA and VirtualNetworkB, you confirm that you are able to access VirtualNetworkB from the company's on-premises network." This indicates the Allow/Use gateway transit is set up working. The next step will be restart/reinstall the VPN-Client config at the windows 10 WS.

Question #31Topic 1
Your company has two on-premises servers named SRV01 and SRV02. Developers have created an application that runs on SRV01. The application calls a service on SRV02 by IP address.
You plan to migrate the application on Azure virtual machines (VMs). You have configured two VMs on a single subnet in an Azure virtual network.
You need to configure the two VMs with static internal IP addresses.
What should you do?
A. Run the New-AzureRMVMConfig PowerShell cmdlet.
B. Run the Set-AzureSubnet PowerShell cmdlet.
C. Modify the VM properties in the Azure Management Portal.
D. Modify the IP properties in Windows Network and Sharing Center.
E. Run the Set-AzureStaticVNetIP PowerShell cmdlet. Most Voted
 
Correct Answer: E üó≥Ô∏è
Specify a static internal IP for a previously created VM
If you want to set a static IP address for a VM that you previously created, you can do so by using the following cmdlets. If you already set an IP address for the
VM and you want to change it to a different IP address, you'll need to remove the existing static IP address before running these cmdlets. See the instructions below to remove a static IP.
For this procedure, you'll use the Update-AzureVM cmdlet. The Update-AzureVM cmdlet restarts the VM as part of the update process. The DIP that you specify will be assigned after the VM restarts. In this example, we set the IP address for VM2, which is located in cloud service StaticDemo.
Get-AzureVM -ServiceName StaticDemo -Name VM2 | Set-AzureStaticVNetIP -IPAddress 192.168.4.7 | Update-AzureVM
